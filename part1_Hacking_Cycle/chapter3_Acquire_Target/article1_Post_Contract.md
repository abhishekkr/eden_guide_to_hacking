# Post Contract

## Persistent Policy

> Get a fixed policy in place for what all you are allowed to access & what all they require you to target while penetration test is being executed.


> Remember that accessible resources & target are not same, several resources may be given to you for better understanding of the scenario but some may be critical enough to be saved from disruption caused even during mock attacks... make this clear to client as well before policy formation.


> Make sure whom to contact for any access clearance, if required in course of your vulnerability assessment.


> And a trustworthy 'handler' of client, who can be reported about any high-alert vulnerability even before presenting the entire analysis report at end.


***

## PenTest Perimeter

> "all" or "everything" shall not be accepted as client might not even think of a resource as being part of attack & feel violated later.


> Clarify the type of penetration tests desired by client... like just a basic analysis of provided target, detailed testing over every possible vulnerability, vulnerability report with all possible counter measures, mention of possible flaws on possible changes made, yada yada yada...


***

## Payment Profile {if it's PAID!}

> Be ready with modular price plans based on target type.


> Have few ready service packages with price based on level of analysis done for different attack zones like Internal Network, Web Services, Data Security, etc.


> Be ready with a very basic Quick Vulnerability Assessment plan for clients for their ease to decide if they require any intense penetration testing plan from you... if you do the job good, they surely will :)
