 |[+] Most creative non-technical hacker practice known to mankind.
 |
 |[+] It's Art of Communication with People for 'Information Leakage'.
 | |
 | |[+] You have a 'Victim' identified by now and wanna collect more
 | | | and more available information related to them.
 | | |_
 | | 
 | |[+] Not just any relevant information, but sensitive details, that
 | | | Victim or related people handover to you in confidence.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] You think like a con-artist, assess weakness of your victim &
 | | | the possibilities of make-believe for them.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] Then you come up with an entire scenario to pose yourself a 
 | | | reliable savior for your Victim to be saved; a benefactor.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] And you will find them revealing such discreet and sensitive
 | | | information so that they can encash the situation to its max.
 | | | And let you gather all sensitive information that you can.
 | | |_
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Example: "The pretend employee loosing access at critical time"
 | |
 | |[+] You are a management personnel on client location in middle of
 | | | a very life-changing deal.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] You need to get some files from your organization's machine or
 | | | file-share; but can't access them due to firewall policies on 
 | | | either side.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] If you can't seal the deal, the failure will take away your job
 | | | and the person refusing you such crucial-moment help.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] And there are many chances that you'll get the data fetched from
 | | | your pretended 'Employee', mailed to you.
 | | |_
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Example: "I'm here to check your Network from Agency"
 | |
 | |[+] You are at home of your Victim when some family member, hopefully
 | | | not much security aware is in-charge and pose as the Network Guy
 | | | from the Telecom Agency they use.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] Offering new organization customer satisfaction mumble-jumble,
 | | | you try to get access to check health status of network devices
 | | | installed there, and more computing devices if possible.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] Now, if the devices are tweakable without any credential request
 | | | from the family member there... try that first.
 | | | If it doesn't work and even they don't have access, then pose as
 | | |  attempting the 'Master Password' so they don't inform the Victim.
