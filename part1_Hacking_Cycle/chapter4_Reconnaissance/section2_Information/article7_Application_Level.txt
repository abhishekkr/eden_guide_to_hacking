[+] Application Level Information
 |
 |[+] Softwares,
 | |
 | |[+] It's the end of launching vulnerability scans in the wild.
 | |
 | |[+] You have a target now, knowledge about applications running on
 | | | a machine leads into major reduction on probable attacks to be
 | | | launched by filtering them with vulnerabilities of application.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] Resolving the particular version of application found would
 | | | further stream-line you with a very specific and and direct
 | | | attack channel which will surely compromise the Target unless
 | | | your Scanner made a mistake or your Target was smart enough to
 | | | fake it or patch it.
 | | |_
 | |_
 | 
 |[+] their Libraries
 | |
 | |[+] You get know the applications (even their versions), but what if
 | | | if they are stable pacthed editions with no known vulnerabilities.
 | | | No worries, all these services are dependent on system & 3rd party
 | | | development libraries for features.
 | | |_
 | |
 | |[+] Investigate about all the libraries involved and then treat them
 | | | as individual applications and iterate them through same procedure.
 | | |_
 | |_ 
 |
 |[+] and Platforms
 | |
 | |[+] Certain applications or at least their returned signature reveals
 | | | the type or sometimes exact O.S. in use, then attacker could try to
 | | | compromise O.S. by bringing it in same software-based recon loop.
 | | |_
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Designed using Protocols
 | |
 | |[+] Different protocols gets into use while designing an application
 | | | and they have flaws of their own which help you to enhance the
 | | | domain to look for specific flaws.
 | | |_
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Implemented using Practices
 | |
 | |[+] An in-correct implementation of a robust security mechanism could
 | | | easily lets attackers in and thus considering all default & possible
 | | | weak configuration scenarios fills in your vulnerability assessment
 | | | to-do list with more flaws.
