[+] Ethical Hacking
 |
 |[+] A Bad Example for this situation ~
 |  "Ethical Hacking is like a practice match played 
 |   for finale of a Cop-Thief game... 
 |   to identify offense tactics of your opponents, 
 |   and likewise work on your defense startegies."
 |
 |[+] It is hacking performed by "Hired" Experts
 |  for determining flaw in a system and report it
 |  to system maintainers for patching.
 |  So that cyber-criminals cannot exploit it.
 |
 |[+] The only point of difference here is 'HIRED'.
 |  So, it's not illegal to exploit the network or
 |    service because you have been hired for it.
 |
 |[+] Making Hacking an Ethical Task ~
 | |
 | |[+] Completing legal formalities for permission
 | |[+] Preparing Vulnerability Assessment Report
 | |[+] Communicating Report just to Client 
 | |[+] Helping in fixing security holes
 | |_ 
 |  
 |[+] Basic Roadmap to Ethical Hacking ~
 | |
 | |[+] You are hired, so Target is already set
 | |[+] Find what is exposed on Target
 | |[+] Research on exploits capable on Target
 | |[+] Suggest patches to fix vulnerabilities
 | |[+] Suggest mechanisms to identify attacks
 | |_
 |  
 |[+] Actually, it's more like 'Legal Hacking'... 
 |  but due to such confusion on term 'Hacking',
 |  it's better coined as 'Ethical Hacking'.
