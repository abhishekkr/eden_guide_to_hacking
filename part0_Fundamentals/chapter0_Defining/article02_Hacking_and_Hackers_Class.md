# Hackers' Dress Code ;)

## WhiteHat

> All security experts who deal into hacking practices in a very ethical & legal way. They are mostly hired professionals for testing security of networks, products or services. They don't break any law while hacking as their attempts are protected by prior hacking permission.

> Though, if some network/product is not covered under context of contract and they face hacking attempt without prior notification. Then it is a disputed action and isn't WhiteHat Hacking scenario.

***

## BlackHat

> They follow anti-WhiteHat philosophy. They hack without any notification to target. Mostly, they hack with malicious intent of money, power, revenge or just plain old-skool dark-fun.

***

## GrayHat

> They are those WhiteHat Hackers who don't wait to get hired to find vulnerabilties and exploits of a system. They feel injustice or careless attitude in any service, product or organization... and they attack.

> They have intent of WhiteHat Hackers and hacking roadmap of BlackHat Hackers.

## Seperate Streams

### The.Mask Hackers

> Those hackers (individual or group), who feel injustice or carelessness to public {common man} and show their wrath in the digital world. They try to become revolutionaries and keep floating on thin ice of Organization's tag of CyberTerrorism.

### Security Suit

> These are secretly hired hackers by Government or powerful organizations with digital 'License To Kill'. They act like online-hitman for Organizations.

### Naked

> These are 'Script Kiddies', who don't analyze technology closely to find a vulnerability, instead re-use other's created tools or so.

> Referred as 'Naked', because that is what they become to hackers designing exploits. As, some hacker with ill-intentions could create an infected material over exploits. This would compromise Script Kiddie's system.

> Were danger to some Ignorant Web Users. Though, the applications were full of simple security holes, there was lack of automated hacking tools. A basic understanding of technology was required even to apply other's hack. So only new recruits of geek-zone were part of Script Kiddies, hacking others.

> Are danger to Maximum General Web Users. Now applications, compilers, platforms & even several technologists are aware of secure development practices. Softwares are more secure than they used to be in earlier days. Still, any exploit in the wild have several fully/semi-automated mechanisms to be used. Thus enabling any mouse-clicking newbie to launch a major attack.
