# Hacker's Aim

> Check for 'Robust-ness' of a system, finding 'Vulnerability' in it... and creating an 'Exploit' for vulnerability. To prepare a 'Threat Model' for 'Target' and work on measures to secure it.


## Robust-ness

> a software/service is as robust as much it can withstand the abrupt, non-workflow behavior from users and still work in a desired secure way

## Vulnerability
Any element of a service/software/technology
compromising it's security parameters.

### Mainly Two Types

#### Design-Level

* flaw in architecture of a software or protocol of a service.

#### Code-Level

* incompetency i.e. logical loopholes in "code" leading to "potential threats"

* incapability i.e. an inherited flaw from compiler/framework/library used which is "present vulnerability" in code

#### Implementation-Level

* a robust software/service implemented without adhering to the security guidelines, still enables Hackers to exploit it.

***


## Threat Model

* Identify vulnerabilities in existing system

* Predict possible threats related to Target

***


## Exploit

> A Proof-of-Concept exploiting Threat Model
