[+] Mental Skills
 |
 |[+] Nice Memory
 | |
 | |[+] Lots of components goes in making a technology
 | |  and loophole in any of them could compromise
 | |  the technology at different levels.
 | | So, one need to have an overview of all components
 | |  to have a working knowledge of the technology to
 | |  be vicitmized and in-depth knowledge of component
 | |  made target to break-in the system.

 |
 |[+] Quick Learner
 | |
 | |[+] If you are in middle of a hack (system break-in),
 | |  and you notice a new technology component or behavior.
 | | It might be some administrator-level advanced tweaking
 | |  or blocking for manual read access.
 | | Or, it might be a new security parameter restricting
 | |  or honepot-logging your move.
 | | Similar and more scenarios require hacker to be quick
 | |  learner and exploit the 'vulnerability with a twist'.
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Analytical
 | |
 | |[+] To rip apart a well working system/service/protocol,
 | |  good analytical technique is an obvious requirement.
 | | And technique to RIP a system is required for a Hacker.
 | |_
 |
 |[+] Solution Finder
 | |
 | |[+] Hacking a Service/Protocol is similar to developing
 | |  the same. Both, starts with a problem.
 | | It's developed due to problem of it's non-existence and
 | |  hacked because of its incompetency for desired feature.
 | |
 | |[+] If a Hacker feels any service is not featured to perform
 | |  in a desired manner instead of being capable to do so.
 | | There is the 'Problem' to be solved.
 | | So, one need to be a good solution finder i.e. capable of
 | |  finding a way to make service work in desired manner using
 | |  the available & (mostly, not always) allowed resources.

 |
 |[+] Lie To Me
 | |
 | |[+] (in Social Engineering) you need to think of several
 | |  stories to be told while posing as someone and make your
 | |  victim handover the information by own will without raising
 | |  suspicion... require real neat mind game and lying tactics.
 | |
 | |[+] (in Software Engineering) you need to devise mocking
 | |  technology components which are fake and un-verified like
 | |  forged & expired digital certificates hoping to be accepted.
 | | Such scenarios are similar to real life lying and need a 
 | |  brain with good lying techniques to think of these.
