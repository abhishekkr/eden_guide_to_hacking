# Computer Skills

## Administration

### Configurations

> The most basic thing to start is learning about all all (or at least major & powerful) configuration options of your target technologies. Even if it wouldn't make you a hacker, it sure does lead to a solid hacking foundation and quick pranks.

### SuperUser

> Tricks to get a superuser access level on system you may call it administrator/root authorization. There are several different ways to do so which will be discussed in "Part1# Hacking Cycle" of this guide. For now, search basics by terms 'KonBoot','OphCrack'

***

## Programming

### Expertise Based

> It simply denotes that in an initial phase, one should opt for a more comfortable coding platform. Like developers with some experience could go for C++, Python, Ruby, Perl, nodeJS, etc. Similarly, people interested from system administration could make an entry using Shell Scripts or PowerShell.

### Domain Based
> In an advanced stage, the choice of language is focused on target to be hacked. A normal network hacking tool could be written as a script in Perl, Python or Ruby. Where it's quick to add/update at every user's end and has very rich library support. But for an untraceable virus/worm/daemon, it's better to be coded in C/C++ or even Assembly. For Memory Overflow attacks, knowledge of Assembly Language.

## Protocols

> Any service/standard goes through a series of brainstorming sessions and get formulated into a set of protocols. RFC for Networks, JSR for Java, or similar other standards. These are basis of big robust technologies built over them. If you are able to find a loophole in it, entire castle falls. Even if you can't break it, they help you understand well.

## Platform

### O.S.

> Use Windows, *nix or Mac; all O.S. platforms have there flaws to be exploited and get pwn3d. System level attacks differ on each O.S., so you need to have a fine exploit-ability know-how of your system choice.

### Hardware

> Several memory overflow techniques need to be tweaked if the processor has an in-built protection in place.

> Several network devices denote a specific flaw, which can be easily exploited instead of trying to break-in.

> Old hardware devices on network refer to presence of a weak link which can't be made total robust for device-level authentication as they don't have such support and must be relying on a MAC-authentication.

***

## Networking

### Devices & Topologies 

> Information about different network components i.e. systems, communication channel and networking devices.

> All network components making up network in a certain pattern which decides up the flow of traffic and its availability.


### IP Addressing

* The entire algorithm and classes behind IP Addressing

* Basics of Subnet, Supernet and NAT (N/w Address Translation)

* IPv4 & IPv6 ~ problems, updates and working standard


### Name Servers

* Working principle of DNS, Root Servers and DNS Zones

* Flaws in basic DNS and attempt to fix that with DNSSEC


##### & much more, like Wireless, Encrypted Channels, Tunneling, etc.
