# Art of Hacking

### from 'Rig Veda'

> "Who so would kill us, whether he be a strange foe or one of us."

Means: "The security parameters could be defeated by
(un/mis)-handled feature or an already compromised
component present within an un-breakable system."


> "Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou arrow, sharpened by our Prayer. Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive."

Means: "Make an exploit robust, accurate, infectious
and untraceable."
