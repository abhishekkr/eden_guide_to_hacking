## Art of Hacking

### From 'Rig Veda'

> "Who so would kill us, whether he be a strange foe or one of us."

Means: _"The security parameters could be defeated by (un/mis)-handled feature or an already compromised component present within an un-breakable system."_


> "Loosed from the Bowstring fly away, thou arrow, sharpened by our Prayer. Go to the foemen, strike them home, and let not one be left alive."

Means: _"Make an exploit robust, accurate, infectious and untraceable."_


### Skills could be seen as 13 chapters of Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' ~

* Laying Plans
> Exploit the parameter never thought to be a part of the security implications of the system.


* Waging War
> Don't overburden yourself with complex routes, if there exist less techie but more easy options.


* Strategic Attack Planning
> Exploit the parameter never thought to be a part of the security implications of the system.


* Tactical Disposition
> First secure your own location & technologies, then you are in safe & stronger place to attack.


* Directed Energy
> Attacking a complex security infrastrucure is no different than a simple one. Break it down.


* Weaknesses & Strengths
> Analyze the system well to aim its vulnerability and leave it's alarm system untouched.


* Engaging the Force
> One can't defeat an opponent without knowledge of opponent's security & service design.


* Variations & Adaptability
> The system, service & security could be set up with any kind of tweaking and hence makes the pre-analysis for attack a failure. Attacker must be always ready to amend its ways.


* The Army on the March
> When to attack, and when to wait. Instincts to stay out of trap & sense enemies.


* Situational Positioning
> Access, attack & safety parameters involved.


* The 9 Battlegrounds
> Different types of security parameters lead to different attack or sometimes no attack practices.


* 5 Ways of Attacking with Fire
> * Break-in target's system with deception
> * Starve the resources powering security
> * Attack availability of service
> * Defeat the implemented security system
> * Infect reachable systems related to target


* Intelligence & Espionage
> Gather as much information possible and try attacks like spear phishing to have a slave.
